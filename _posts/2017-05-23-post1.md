I am excited to be posting my first blog to my new website. In future, I will streamline the process of blog creation through the use of org mode publishing within EMACS, my new favorite text editor!

If I might gush about EMACS for a few. Whether through Vim or EMACS, a text editor can be a powerful tool. I love that I have org mode available to me to take notes. Or that I can set up a calendar to give me just the information that I am interested in, in the way that I want to see it. That harkens to the level of customization available within these powerful text editors and I am thoroughly enjoying experimenting with them.
